# Virtual Tennis+

Virtual Tennis+ is a single-player VR tennis game developed in Unity, designed to deliver an immersive and interactive sports experience.  
Its standout feature is seamless integration with a **Companion App**, allowing players to control shots and gameplay dynamics through their smartphone sensors.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay
The game offers two main modes:
- **Arcade Mode** â€“ Choose the opponent's difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and play quick matches.
- **Tournament Mode** â€“ Face opponents of increasing difficulty, earning trophies with each win. A single defeat returns you to the main menu.

The player can:
- Control the racket via **keyboard** or **Companion App**.
- Perform strong or weak shots depending on gesture speed.
- Switch between first-person and third-person views.
- Pause and navigate menus directly from the app or keyboard.

## ðŸ›  Technical Overview
- **Architecture**: Clientâ€“server model, with the game acting as the server and the Companion App as the client.
- **Networking**:  
  - UDP broadcast (port 5001) for discovery.  
  - TCP/IP connection for continuous communication and automatic reconnection.
- **Core Components**:
  - `CaricaPersonaggio` â€“ Dynamically loads chosen player/AI prefabs.
  - `CaricaScena` â€“ Handles asynchronous scene loading with camera animations.
  - `Musica` (singleton) â€“ Manages background music across scenes.
  - `RacchettaManager` (singleton) â€“ Manages app connection and command processing.
  - `GestionePunteggio` â€“ Controls scoring logic, game states, and camera events.
  - `Giocatore` / `Bot` â€“ Player and AI logic, each inheriting from `GiocatoreBase`.
  - `Palla` â€“ Governs ball movement, collisions, and point assignment.

## ðŸŽ¯ AI Difficulty Levels
Implemented via the `IDifficolta` interface:
- **Easy**: Slow speed, high error rates.
- **Medium**: Balanced stats.
- **Hard**: High speed, low error probability.

## ðŸ“· Camera System
The `CameraController` supports smooth transitions between perspectives using linear (`lerp`) and spherical (`slerp`) interpolation.
