# Virtual Tennis+

Virtual Tennis+ is a single-player VR tennis game developed in Unity, designed to deliver an immersive and interactive sports experience.  
Its standout feature is seamless integration with a **Companion App**, allowing players to control shots and gameplay dynamics through their smartphone sensors.

## ðŸŽ® Gameplay
The game offers two main modes:
- **Arcade Mode** â€“ Choose the opponent's difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard) and play quick matches.
- **Tournament Mode** â€“ Face opponents of increasing difficulty, earning trophies with each win. A single defeat returns you to the main menu.

The player can:
- Control the racket via **keyboard** or **Companion App**.
- Perform strong or weak shots depending on gesture speed.
- Switch between first-person and third-person views.
- Pause and navigate menus directly from the app or keyboard.

## ðŸ›  Technical Overview
- **Architecture**: Clientâ€“server model, with the game acting as the server and the Companion App as the client.
- **Networking**:  
  - UDP broadcast (port 5001) for discovery.  
  - TCP/IP connection for continuous communication and automatic reconnection.
